# Midsommer Madness 🇸🇪

Midsommer Madness is a Swedish-themed action retro arcade game inspired by *Redneck Rampage* and the Swedish Midsummer holiday. 

Help Sven race against the solar timer to reach the Maypole (*midsommarstång*) before sundown! If you fail, the solstice is lost, you trigger a meltdown, and you are sacrificed to the Wicker Man.

## 🎮 Level Sequence

The game features ten distinct thematic levels:
1. **IKEA Warehouse:** Battle crowded, flatpack-carrying shoppers who throw box projectiles at you.
2. **Systembolaget:** The state-owned liquor shop crowded with drunk Swedes stumbling and lobbing green beer bottles.
3. **Lördagsgodis:** Sugar rush Saturday! Dodge hyperactive, strung-out Swedish kids throwing sweet candy projectiles.
4. **The Swedish Pub:** Sing along with Frank Zappa fans singing "Bobby Brown" (shouting and firing glowing letters `B`, `O`, `B`, `B`, `Y`).
5. **Volvo Highway:** A survival lane-crossing level where boxy blue Volvo station wagons zoom across lanes at high speeds.
6. **Dalarna Forest:** Deep green woods where giant red wooden Dalarna Horses charge at Sven in sudden dash-bursts.
7. **Allemansrätten:** Swedish right to roam! Harvest wild cloudberries while dodging aggressive elk charging and stomping.
8. **Kvinnafängelset:** Escape the Swedish women's prison! Dodging strict guards throwing heavy metal handcuffs.
9. **Avicii Rave:** A dark neon rave under strobe lights. Dance through ravers wearing shades who throw glowing glowsticks.
10. **ABBA Disco:** The final level under glowing purple lights. Chrome ABBA Bots fire multi-directional pink disco laser spreads. Reach the Maypole in the center to save Midsummer!

## 🛠️ Combat & Mechanics

- **Fixed Timestep Loop:** Game logic updates at a solid 60Hz timestep, while rendering runs at the browser's maximum frame rate (interpolated) to ensure smooth gameplay.
- **Hockey Stick (Melee):** Left-click swings the stick in front of Sven towards the cursor, damaging and knocking back enemies. Alternatively, press **H** as a keyboard shortcut.
- **Surströmming Bomb (Ranged):** Right-click or Space throws a canned fermented herring that explodes, creating a lingering toxic green gas cloud that damages all enemies inside.
- **Swedish Power-Ups:**
  - **Köttbullar (Meatballs):** Restores 25 energy.
  - **Knäckebröd (Crispbread):** Grants a 4-second speed boost (+50% speed) and a yellow dotted forcefield shield (blocks 80% of damage).
- **Procedural Synthesizer (Web Audio API):** All game music and SFX are procedurally synthesized in real-time, adjusting BPM, scales, and motifs depending on the level (e.g. happy chiptunes, acoustic folk, heavy metal, EDM, and disco).
- **Screen Shake:** Dynamic impact feedback on hits and stomps.

## 📱 Flutter App Wrapping & CLI Build

This project is wrapped in a full-screen, landscape-locked Flutter `WebViewWidget` that runs the web-based game. It features:
* **Mobile Touch Controls**: A virtual joystick zones and action buttons on mobile touch layouts.
* **Aspect-Ratio Scaling**: Automatic resizing of the HTML5 canvas to fit mobile screen resolutions.
* **Sticky Full-Screen Immersive Mode**: Hides system status bars and navigation menus using Flutter's native window/system chrome configurations.
* **Bypassed Audio Gesture Constraints**: Autoplay is enabled on the WebView so audio triggers without needing explicit user touch gestures.

### Flutter Project Structure
- [main.dart](file:///home/xbill/midsommer-flutter/lib/main.dart): Sets up full-screen immersive view, locks orientation to landscape, configures the `WebViewController`, and loads assets.
- [pubspec.yaml](file:///home/xbill/midsommer-flutter/pubspec.yaml): Manages Dart packages and registers game assets (`assets/` directory) to compile them into the application bundle.
- [index.html](file:///home/xbill/midsommer-flutter/assets/index.html): Mobile-first touch UI canvas and entry point.

### 🛠️ Building and Deploying via CLI (Makefile)

We provide a [Makefile](file:///home/xbill/midsommer-flutter/Makefile) to simplify local development, compilation, and logs monitoring:

1. **Local Web Development**:
   ```bash
   make dev
   ```
   *Serves files directly from the assets directory to play in the browser.*

2. **Compile Android Debug APK**:
   ```bash
   make build-apk
   ```
   *Runs `flutter build apk --debug` to produce a debug APK.*

3. **Install on Connected Device/Emulator**:
   ```bash
   make install-apk
   ```
   *Installs the compiled build using `flutter install`.*

4. **Monitor Device Logs**:
   ```bash
   make logcat
   ```
   *Views real-time logs using `flutter logs`.*

5. **Clean Workspace Caches**:
   ```bash
   make clean
   ```
   *Cleans the Flutter project build directories and temporary caches.*
